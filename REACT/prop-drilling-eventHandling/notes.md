1. As we know if we want to update any changes, we need state to be updated. i.e. react will not update the DOM if we don't use state. So, we need to use state to update the changes.

2. Our data is in main App component and we button is in Card component.

3. state jaha banti hai wahi modify ki jaa skti hai

4. Create a function which can modify the state of realData and pass it as props to Card component i.e. parent to child.

5. Because state is not updated in Card component, we need to pass the state as props to Card component
